  <h2>What is This Place?</h2>
  <p>30XX-club is a hyper-decentralized text-only message board / forum / community. It is being written by <a href="https://xxangelfire.com">xxangelfire</a> and will
  be passed off to the <a href="https://twitter.com/30xx_fi">30XX-DAO</a> when it is ready. These are the essential points:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All posts on the site are hosted on IPFS</li>
    <li>Posts are made by interacting with a smart-contract on the <a href="https://junonetwork.io">Juno</a> network</li>
    <li>Posted content is immutable but the displayed content is moderated</li>
    <li>The site is entirely moderated by its users (ie the DAO)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>30XX-club is the first dApp I intend to deliver to the 30XX-DAO but it is very much not the last.</p>
  <h2>Organization</h2>
  <p>The site is organized into boards centering around a topic. Within each board there are threads, and within
  each thread there are individual posts. Anyone can make a post, thread or board.</p>
  <h2>DAO Moderation</h2>
  <p>DAO members moderate this site by voting with their governance tokens to remove posts when needed. Moderation votes have very low requirements for quorum
  because all stakers need not be moderators.</p>
